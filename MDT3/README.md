<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
This project is a virtual reality take on a diner game. Food will be spawned on the central counter of the scene, 
and it is the responsability of the user to move food from the counter to one of the tables in the room. Four
different types of food spawn, and each type has as specific table it is supposed to be delivered to.
